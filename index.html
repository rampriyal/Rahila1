<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Magnesium deficiency appears on the oldest leaves of palms as broad chlorotic (yellow) bands along the margins with the central portion of the leaves remaining distinctly green. In severe cases leaflet tips may become necrotic. <br>Older leaves become bronzed and dry appearance. Leaflets show necrosis and turn to reddish brown with translucent spots yellowing starts at the tip and spreads to the base.</br></p>

  <li>Boron deficiency is caused by insufficient boron in the soil. It may be caused by soil drying and high soil pH, while temporary boron deficiency is caused by heavy leaching. Symptoms always occur on newly emerging leaves, and remain visible on these leaves as they mature and are replaced by younger leaves.<br> One of the earliest symptoms of boron deficiency on coconut palm is leaf wrinkling and manifested as sharply bent leaflet tips, commonly called “hook leaf”. These sharp leaflet hooks are quite rigid and cannot be traightened out without tearing the leaflets. Leaves have a serrated zigzag appearance.</br> One of the most common symptoms of boron deficiency is the failure of newly emerging spear leaves to open normally. In a chronic stage, multiple unopened spear leaves may be visible at the apex of the canopy. Boron deficiency also occurs in inflorescence and nuts. The inflorescence and nuts are become necrotic.

Correction measure: Application of borax/sodium tetraborate 0.2% (2 g/l of water), (75-100 ml/seedling), borax/ sodium tetraborate/octaborate 15-20 g/plan.

  <li>Magnesium deficiency appears on the oldest leaves of palms as broad chlorotic (yellow) bands along the margins with the central portion of the leaves remaining distinctly green. In severe cases leaflet tips may become necrotic. Older leaves become bronzed and dry appearance. Leaflets show necrosis and turn to reddish brown with translucent spots yellowing starts at the tip and spreads to the base.

Correction measure: Soil application of MgSO4 1-2 Kg/tree/year. Root feeding of 200 ml of 0.2% MgSO4 twice a year

      <li>Iron typical symptoms are yellowish-green or yellowish-orange leaflets. Older leaves are remaining green. Leaves droop as the stem becomes weak. In older palms, leaf number and size are reduced. Sometimes an apron of dead fronds develops around the stem due to weakness of the rachis. Nuts may fall prematurely. Copra is rubbery and of poor market quality.

Correction measure: Soil application of gypsum 2 - 5 kg/tree/year. Root feeding of 0.2% gypsum

</li>
      <li>Iron deficiency usually appears on palms growing in poorly aerated soils or those that have been planted too deeply. Water logged soils and deep planting effectively suffocate the roots and reduce their effectiveness in taking up nutrients such as iron. <br>The main symptom of iron deficiency is chlorosis or yellowing between the veins of new leaves (uniform chlorotic new leaves as the deficiency progresses, the tips become necrotic and leaf size reduced).</br>

Correction measure: Application of FeSO4 0.25 to 0.5 Kg/tree/year

</li>
    
 
  <li>The newest leaves of manganese deficient palms emerge chlorotic with longitudinal necrotic streaks. As the deficiency progresses, newly emerging leaflets appear necrotic and withered on all but basal portions of the leaflets. This withering results in a curling of the leaflets about the rachis giving the leaf a frizzled

appearance (‘frizzle top’). On new leaves of manganese-deficient palm, necrotic leaflet tips fall off and the leaf has a signed appearance. In severely manganese deficient palms, growth stops and newly emerging leaves consist solely of necrotic petiole stubs.

Correction measure: Soil application of MnSO4 @ 10 Kg/acre
